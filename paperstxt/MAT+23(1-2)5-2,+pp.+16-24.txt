ABSTRACT
Let G be a finite group containing a p-complement and Let R a complete discrete valuation ring with
ideal maximal (P) and residue field k = R/(P) of characteristic p. In this paper we show that the
regular representation can be decomposed as direct sum of tensor product of modules. Moreover, we
prove that G satisfies the Alperin’s weight conjecture in characteristic p.
RESUMEN
Sea el grupo finito G, con p complemento, y sea el anillo R una discreta valuación completa, con campo
residual k de característica p. En este trabajo se demuestra que la representación regular RG se
descompone como una suma directa de productos tensoriales de módulos. Además se verifica que G
satisface la Conjetura de Alperin en característica p.
1. INTRODUCTION
A Hall divisor of an integer n is a divisor d of n such that d and n/d are coprime. For example, the Hall
divisors of 24 are 1, 3, 8, and 24.
A Hall subgroup of a finite group G is a subgroup whose order is a Hall divisor of the order of G. If is a set
of primes, then a Hal -subgroup is a subgroup whose order is a product of primes in , and whose index is
not divisible by any primes in .
If p is a prime number, we write p´ for the set of all primes not equal to p. A Hall p-subgroup of a finite group
G is called a p-complement.
Let G be a finite group containing a p-complement and (F, R, k) ap-modular sys-tem. In the present paper
are given descriptions of the blocks of finite groups with p-complement. We show that G satisfies the Alperin’s
weight conjecture. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 contains some results in modular
representation theory of finite groups. In the section 3 we show that the indecomposable projective modules
can be expressed as a tensor product of modules. In section 4 we verify the Alperin’s weight conjecture. In
section 5 we verify the Alperin’s weight conjecture in block form.
1.1 Notations and Definitions
Let G be a finite group, p be a prime divisor of G  and R be a complete discrete valuation ring with
quotient field F of characteristic 0. We assume that the residue field k = R/() has characteristic p, where ()
denotes the unique maximal ideal of R. With this assumption we refer to the triple (F; R; k) as a splitting
p-modular system, and J(G) denotes the Jacobson radical of this ring of RG. We denote the largest normal
p-subgroup of G by O (G), and denote the´p-core of G by O (G). We denote a p-complement of G by H
p p´ p´
(G). The factor group G = G/O (G) is called reduced group modulo O (G). We denote the subgroup
p p
O (G)  H (G) of G by
p p´
16
~G
. If H is any subgroup of G then [G/H] denotes the set of representatives of left
cosets gH.

Lemma 2.0.1. Let G be a finite group. Then the simple RG-modules are precisely the simple k
~G
-modules
made in to RG-modules via the surjection RG  k
~G
.
Proof. If S is a simple k
~G
-module, then also S is a simple k
~G
-module, since RG/Ip = (G)  k
~G
and Ip(G)
annihilates the simple RG-modules.
Recall that if p is a prime, then an element in a finite group is said to be p-regulari fith as order prime top.
Proposition 2.0.2. Let G be a finite group. Then the number of non-isomorphic simple RG-modules equals
the number of conjugacy classes of p-regular elements of the reduced group G .
Proof. It well known that the number of non-isomorphic simple k
~G
-modules equals the number of conjugacy
classes of p-regular elements of G(See 3 theorem 9.11).There sult follows by (2.0.1). 
Proposition 2.0.3. Let G be a finite group.
1. For each simple RG-module S there is an indecomposable projective kG-module P = kGe. Here e is a
S

primitive idempotent in kG such thate S 0.
2. For each simple RG-module S there is an indecomposable projective RG-module P
S
 R G ˆe with the
property that ˆP
S
/(  ˆ )P
S
 P
S
is the projective cover of S as a kG-module. Here eˆ is a primitive
idempotentin RG Duch that ˆe  0.
Proof.
1. As k is Artinian ring and kG is a k-algebra finitely generated as k-vector space, it is Artinian. Therefore kG
can be expressed as the direct sum of indecomposable projective kG-modules. Then we can write
1 = e +…+ e in kG, where the e are primitive orthogonal idempotents. Hence for each simple RG-module
1 n i
S there is a unique summand e such that eS  0. We define P = kGe. Since e is a primitive idempotent
i i S i i
the result follows.
2. We omit the proof (See (3( proposition (9.15)).
Proposition 2.0.4. Let G be a finite group
1. Every finitely-generated indecomposable projective kG-module M is isomorphic to P for some simple
S
module S.
2. Every finitely-generated indecomposable projective RG-module Mˆ is isomorphic to ˆP
S
for some simple
module S.
Proof.
1. As kG is Artinian ring and M is finitely-generated indecomposable projective, it is Artinian. Hence the
radical quotient M/Rad(M)  S is a simple kG-module. By last proposition we have
M/Rad(M)  PS/Rad(PS)  S
By Nakayama’s lemma (See (3 (theorem 7.6) the modules M and PS are projective covers of the irradical
quotients, so M  PS by uniqueness of projective covers (See (3 (proposition 7.8).
2. We omit the proof (See 3 proposition 9.15 part 1).
3. QUASI-SIMPLE AND PROJECTIVE MODULES
Let G be a finite group with p-complement H (G). Observe that the reduced group
p´
18
G also has a
p-complement H
p´
( G ) which is isomorphic to H (G). A minimal p-subgroup H of G relative to which the
p´
indecomposable module U is projective is called a vertex of U, and it is defined up to conjugacy in G.
Theorem 3.0.5. Let G be a finite group with p-complement H (G). Set P  Syl (G) and
p´ p
P = P/O (G) 
p

1. If S t a b

2. If S t a b

is semisimple and each direct summand S is a simple projective
R G -module with vertex O (G).
p
Observe that k  GP  k H
p ´
( G )  as kG-modules. The kG-module k H
p ´
( G )  can be decomposed as a direct
sum of simple kG-modules, since Rad(kH (G)) = 0. From
p´
k  GP  GH

 k G it follows that any simple kG-
module is the direct sum of simple k H
p ´
( G )   modules. Further more these t of this direct sum m and s
contains a complete list of simple RG-modules. In fact, if the set x ,...,x (x  P) is a set of representatives of
1 |P| i
the left cosets G/H (G) then any element g  G can be expressed in the form g = xy where x  P and y 
p´
H (G). Thus we make use of the following general isomorphism
p´
kG  kP  kH (G) (3.0.2)
k p´
which arises because kG has as a basis the elements xy where x  P and y  H (G), and kP 
p´ k
k(Hp´(G)( has as a basis the corresponding elements x ( y.

1. By assumption S = S

Let R be a complete discrete valuation ring with maximal ideal () and residue field k = R/(). Let G be a
finite group with p-complement and splitting field k. Assume that S is a simple RG-module. Then the finitely-
generated RG-module Q is called quasi-simple RG-module if it is free as R-module and Q/()Q  S for some
simple RG-module S.
Theorem 3.0.6. Let G be a finite group with p-complement H (G). Every simple RG-module S has a quasi-

The quasi-simple RG-module Q is called quasi-simple RG-module corresponding to S. Let R be a discrete
S
valuation ring with maximal ideal ( ) and residue field k = R/(P) of characteristic p. Let GGL(n, R) be a
representation of G. Then the homomorphism
19
 : G GL(n, k) induced by the natural projection GL(n, R) 
GL(n, k) is called reduction of modulo p.
Lemma 3.0.7. Let G be a finite group and let Q be a quasi-simple RG-module. Assume that GGL (Q)
n
is a representation of G and  : G GL (Q/)Q) the reduction of  modulo p. Set L =   g  G and
n g
L =  
g
 g  G. Then rank L  rank L.
R
Proof. Set m = rak L. Let d ,…,d be a R-basis of L. Consider the surjection : L 
R 1 m
L given by (d) = d
i i
(i = 1,…,m). Thus g
1
,..., g
m
is spanning set for L . Hence the result follows. 
Theorem 3.0.8. Let G be a finite group. Let  : G  GL (Q): be an R-representation of G. Then Q is a
n
quasi-simple RG-module if and only if   g  G = End (Q)  M (R), where M (R) denotes the ring of the n
g R n n
 n-matrices over R.
Proof. If Q is quasi-simple then  : G  GL (Q/)Q) is absolutely simple, since k is a splitting field of G.
n
Therefore    g  G = End (Q/)Q) by the classical Burnside theorem. According to the last lemma it
g R
follows that rank   g  G = n2. Conversely, if   g  G = = End (Q) then 
R g g R
  g  G = End (Q/()Q).
g R
Hence End (Q()Q)G = (End (Q/()Q) = Z(End (Q/()Q))  k, so Q()Q is absolutely simple. This
k kG k
completes the proof of this implication. 
Theorem 3.0.9. Let G be a finite group. Then the RG-module Q is a quasi-simple RG-module if and only if
End (Q)  R, with the endomorphisms acting as scalar multiplication.
RG
Proof. Let  be an R-representation of G corresponding to Q. According to the last theorem we have
  g  G = End (Q). Since End (Q)G = End (Q) it follows that Z(End (Q)) = End (Q). Conversely if
g R R RG R RG
End (Q)  R then End (Q/()Q)  k. Hence Q/()Q is absolutely simple RG-module, which complete the
RG kG
proof of this of this implication. 
Lemma 3.0.10. Let G = K  H where K is a p-group and H has order prime to p. If S is any simple RG-module
then Pˆ = RK  Q .
S R S
Proof. Since kH is semisimple we may write kH = k  U for some kH-module U. Thus Pˆ = R is a projective
R
RH-module and we may write RH = R  ˆU for some projective RH-module ˆU , and now RG = RH G UG .
H H
Here RGRK as RG-modules, and so RK is projective, being a summand of RG. Therefore RK  R Q is
H R S
projective (See [3] proposition 8.4). Now
RK  Q /()(RK  Q )  kK  S.
R S R S R
We have
Rad(kK  S)  (Rad(kK)kK)  S.
R R
since K is a normal p-subgroup and so acts trivially on S. As Rad(kK)kK)  S has codimension in kK  S
k R
equal to dim S we have that kK  S/Rad(kK  S)  S. Since kK  S is projective we obtain that
k k k
RK  Q /Rad(RK  Q )  S.

By proposition (2.0.3) we conclude that Pˆ = RK  Q .

4. ALPERIN'S WEIGHT CONJECTURE
Let G be a finite group and k an algebraically closed field of characteristic p. Alperin defines a weight to be
a pair (P, V ) where P  G is a p-subgroup and V is a p-block of defect zero of N (P) / P. We take P up to
G
conjugacy and V up to isomorphism. Alperin Weight Conjeture. The number of weights of G equals the
number of conjugacy classes of elements of G of order prime to p (AWC). The conjecture connects two sets
which otherwise are seemingly unrelated. The simple modules are enumerated by Brauer's theorem and this
is easy. The blocks of defect zero are notoriously dificult to pin down in generality. The conjecture is known to
be true for
1. p-solvable groups (Okuyama)
2. Groups of Lie type in defining characteristic.
3. Symmetric groups
4. Many sporadic simple groups
Lemma 4.0.12. Let G be a finite group with p-complement H (G). The Green correspondence induces a
p´
bijection between the simple kG-modules with vertex P  Syl (G) and the non-isomorphic simple k[N (P)]-
p G
modules.
Proof. Let S be a simple kG-module with vertex P. Then SG = f(S)  X where f(S) is the unique
N (P)
G
indecomposable summand with vertex P in any decomposition of SG as direct sum of indecomposable
N (P)
G
modules and each summand of X is projective relative to a subgroup of the form N (P) g P with
G
g  G - N (P) by Green correspondence theorem part 1(See [3] theorem 11:26). Since P is a Sylow p-
G
subgroup P = O (N (P)), i.e., P is a p-radical subgroup. Hence we can write N (P) = P  H, where  N (P) :
p G G G
H =  P , by the classical Shur-Zassenhaus theorem. For any element g  G can be expressed as a
product xy with x  P and y  H (G), so N (P) contains a p-complement H (N (P))  H (G). Since S is a
p´ G p´ G p´
simple k[H (G)]-module and H (NG(P)) has order prime to p we can write SG = V … V ,where
p´ p´ H (N (P)) 1 m
p´ G
the V are simple k[H (NG(P))]-modules whit vertex P. Since the simple k[N (P)]-modules are precisely the
i p´ G
simple k[H (NG(P))]-modules we deduce that f(S) is a simple k[N (P)]-module and X = 0. If V is a simple
p´ G
k[N (P)]-module then VG = g(V)  Y , where g(V ) is an indecomposable kG-module with vertex P and
G N (P)
G
each summand of Y is an indecomposable projective relative to a subgroup of the form gP  P where
g  G - N (P) by Green Correspondence part 2. Now kP  V is an indecomposable projective k[N (P)]-
G G
module by theorem (3:0:11). Therefore kP  VG is a projective kG-module, so kP  g(V ) is also
N (P)
G
projective kG-module and we have kP  g(V ) = P … P for various indecomposable projective
S1 Sn
modules P . Thus it follows that kP  g(V) / Rad(kP  g(V ))  k g(V )  g(V )  S … S by uniqueness
Si 1 n
of projective covers. Since g(V ) is indecomposable kG-module we obtain n = 1 and g(V )  S . By Green
1
correspondence theorem par 3 it follows that gf(S)  S and fg(V)  V . So we are done. 
Theorem 4.0.13. Let G be a finite group with p-complement H (G) and let k be a field of characteristic p.
p´
Then G satisfy (AWC).
Proof. Let S ,…,S a complete list of simple kG-modules with vertex P  Syl (G). According to the last lemma
1 n p
there is a complete list V ,…,V of simple k[N (P)]-modules. Since P is p-radical subgroup we have
1 n G
N (P) = P  H (N (P)). Hence the simple k[N (P)]-modules are precisely the simple k[H (N (P))]-modules.
G p´ G G p´ G
Therefore the pairs (P, V) are weights for G. Let U ,…,U be a complete list of simple kG-modules with vertex
i 1 m
O (G). Applying again the lemma (4:0:12) we obtain that the pairs (O (G); U) are weights for G. Suppose that the
p p i
pair (D; M) is a weight for G. Assume that O (G) < D < P. Since g = xy with x  P and  2 H (G) for all
p p´
g  G we deduce that N (D) contains a p-complement H (N (D)) · H (G). By Green correspondence theorem we

have M

G
 HN
G
(D )
is projective kG-module, so (kD  g(M)) is also
projective kG-module. Thus kP  g(M) = P … P for various indecomposable projective modules P . Since

g(M) is indecomposable we deduce that g(M)  S , a contradiction. So we finish the proof. 

We may now apply again the last lemma. (
Theorem 5.0.16. Let G be a finite group with p-complement Hp´(G). Each block of Kg can be
induced from Hp´(G) to G.
Proof. Observe that if 1 = e +…+ e is the sum of blocks k[O ´(G)] then for each i and g  G the conjugate
1 m p
geg-1 is also a block of k[O (G)]. For this we verify that this element is idempotent, and also that it is central in
i p
k[O (G)], which is so some if x  O ´0(G) then x(geg-1) = g(g-1xg)eg-1 = (geg-1)x. Furthermore geg-1 is
p´ p i i i i
primitive in Z(kO ) since if it were the sum of two orthogonal central idempotents, on conjugating back by g-1
p´
we wold be able to deduce that ei is not primitive either. Since the blocks of k[O (G)] are uniquely
p´
determined, and it follows that geg-1 = e for some j. Thus G permutes the blocks of k[O (G)]. We denote the
i j p´
G-orbit of e by Orb (e). We define f =

G i 1 2
idempotents in Z(kG). Then gfg-1 = f for any g  G. Since f is the sum of the elements of the G-obit

of e we deduce that f = f , a contradiction. This shows that f is primitive in Z(kG). Thus we can write

where each summand di is a block of kG. So we are done.
Lemma 5.0.17. Let G be a finite group with p-complement H (G). Then C (O (G)) contains a p-complement.

Proof. Obvious.
Theorem 5.0.18. Let G be a finite group with p-complement H (G). If O (G) is the p-complement of
p´ p´
C (O (G)) then each block of kG lies in k[O (G)], and is the sum of a G-conjugacy class of blocks of
G p p´
k[O (G)].

Proof. Since O (G) is a normal p-subgroup every block of kG lies in k[CG(O (G))] and is the sum of a G-orbit
p p´
of blocks of C (O (G))(See [3] proposition 15:9). Furthermore each block of k[C (O (G))] is the sum of a
G p G p
C (O (G))-conjugacy class of blocks of k[O (G)] (See [3] proposition 12:7). Since each block of kG is stable
G p p´
under conjugation by G the result follows.
We denote the fixed point set of O .(G) under conjugation in G by J (G). We may check that J (G) is a
p p´ p´
normal p-subgroup of G, which is immediate.
Theorem 5.0.19. Let G be a finite group with p-complement H (G) and P  Syl (G). Then O (N (P)) = J (G).
p´ p p´ G p´
Proof. Since P is radical subgroup we may write N (P) = P  H (N (P)) by the classical Schur-Zassenhaus

theorem, where H (N (P)) is a p-complement of N (P). As J (G)  C (P) is the p-complement of C (P) and
p´ G G p´ G G
O (N (P)) · C (P) the assertion follows. 

Definition 5.0.20. If (P, V ) is a weight for G, then V belongs to a block b of N (P) and this block corresponds
G
with a block Bl of G via the Brauer correspondence, hence we can say that the weight (P, V ) belongs to the
block Bl of G so the weights are partitioned into blocks.
(Alperin's Conjeture Block Form) The number of weights in a block of G equals the number of simple
modules in the block(ACBF).
Lemma 5.0.21. Let G be a finite group with p-complement H .(G) and S and T two simple modules with vertex

P  Syl (G). Assume that Bl is a block of G and this block corresponds with a block b of N (P) via the Brauer
p G
correspondence. If S and T lie in the block Bl with defect group P then S G and TG lie in the block b
N (P) N (P)
G G
with defect group P.
Proof. If S and T lie in the same block then there is a list of simple kG-modules S = S ,…,S = T with vertex P
1 n
such that S and S are both composition factors of the some indecomposable projective module kP  S for
i i+1 i
each i = 1,…,n - 1. By lemma (4.0.12) we have a list of simple k[N (P)]-modules SG = V ,…,V = TG .

Suppose that 0  P …P is a composition series of the regular representation of P. Since P is a p-group,
1 n
all the composition factors are trivial representation, k. Because -  S preserves exact sequences we have
k i
0  P  Si  ... P  S = P . Therefore V and V are both composition factors of the some
1 k n k i Si i i+1
indecomposable projective module kP  V for each i = 1,…,n - 1. Thus the result follows. 

Then G satisfy (ACBF).
Proof. If (P, V ) and (P, U) belongs to the block Bl then g(V) and g(U) belongs to the block Bl by last lemma. If
(O (G); S) belongs to the same block Bl then S lie in the block Bl, since N (O (G)) = G. So we are done. 
