The solution fo r previous equation could be only solved by
numerically. There are several known root (cid:976)inding method

We use classical Newton’s method to obtain these solutions.
In order to study the behavior of these solutions we
compute the (cid:976)irst 1000 eigenvalues for the process Z(k) in
[0, 1] for 100 different values of k, (k = (i - 1)10-2, where
i = 1,2,⋯,100). We work with equation (7).
The implementation of Newton’s method requires a star-

for Z(k) exhibits a similar behavior as the Wiener process
itself. This result could be used with theoretical purposes.
The most important point to note here is the numerical re-
sults obtained for the eigenvalues. It seems that a further
analysis on these numerical computations of the eigenval-
ues for Z(k) could serve to (cid:976)ind the speci(cid:976)ic behavior of the
sequence (c(k)) .
